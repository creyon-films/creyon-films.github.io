	PART 1...
	
		ACTOR 1 enters, walking right next to the
		edge of the stage, facing away from the crowd.
		They're holding a Promark BYOS Marching drumstick.
		
		Fifteen seconds later ACTOR 1 throws the stick,
		violently yelling "NO!" at maximum volume, before
		casually walking off stage.
		
		Two seconds later everyone backstage stomps as hard
		as they can, yelling "YES!" at maximum volume.
		
	PART 2...
	
		Two actors enter, ACTOR 2 and 3. They're both black, 
		and around senior age.
		
		For 20 seconds, they point at random audience members
		and yelling "Hey!" as if they knew the person they pointed
		at. After the 20 seconds expire, they jump twice, and then
		Party Rock Shuffle off the stage.
		
		Actor 1 and 2 enter, while they're having an improvised conversation.
		Actor 2 listens to Actor 1 while looking away from him and then starts
		talking over Actor 1 mid-sentence.
		
		Actor 1 doesn't stop, but keeps talking. However, both actors are looking
		at each other and nodding in agreement as they talk, like they were having
		a normal conversation.
		
		After they converse for 2 minutes, they stop abruptly and everyone walks off
		stage in unison.
		
	PART 3..
	
		ACTORS 3, 7, 2, 5 enter, walking to the center of the stage.
		
		ACTOR 5 is holding a soapbox. He steps to the left 8 times
		and puts it down, before standing on it and clearing his throat
		very loudly.
		
		ACTOR 5 starts a speech.
		
		
							ACTOR 5
			(speaking in a badly done Southern British accent)
		We need to raise the green for future grain. They can't conceal
		that tar for these royal kicks.
		
		Everyone claps 6 times, before letting out a short scream of agony
		simulatenously. It seems that everyone is liking what ACTOR 5 is saying.
		
		2 seconds, actors 4 and 6 walk in. Actor 4 is clapping in a 3/4 time signature,
		while Actor 6 is holding an alarm clock, setting the alarm off 9 times, and
		on the 9th time, Actor 6 yells a random word in any language other than English.
		
		(This is up for the actor to decide.)
		
		Shortly after, Actor 6 drops the clock, and does a heel click. Actor 3 stomps as
		they sing a tune about work, in the style of a blues musician.
		
	PART 4...
	
		ACTOR 2 and 3 are having a conversation with BAND TEACHER about Donald Trump.
		
		"He's in the year," says ACTOR 2, blinking six times.
		
		"!!," replies BAND TEACHER, talking an over-exaggerated bite out of a
		McChicken sandwich.
		
		ACTOR 3 nods occasionally as if he agrees, but he actually diagrees.
		He's sending mixed signals. He loves her, but she doesn't love him.
		
		Suddenly ACTOR 1 enters, holding a shirt. He takes the shirt and
		spits on it before laying it on the ground and lying down in the shirt
		as he screams "Y'all don't know the true mind!" 13 1/2 times.
		
	PART 5...
	
		ACTOR 2 goes on stage waving his arms around. "He's cleaner than the floorboards."
		
		"Ahoy my pop, get the slop gaap dops, graham geen," exclaims ACTOR 5, walking
		on stage.
		
		Actor 5 then jumps, falling over into a crate. He decides to take a cozy nap.
		
		Actor 7 jumps off stage and starts asking people for money and security.
		
		ACTOR 7 then fucking falls over onto someone in the theater and doesn't get up
		until the 7th act.
		
	PART 6...
	
		ACTOR 7 walks on stage as everyone else does cartwheels off the stage
		and running out screaming as an exit to go backstage.
		
		ACTOR 7 sits down.
		"I love Casey Neistatの?!" she exclaims with great passion before
		taking out a bag of chips and blowing into it repeatedly for
		30 seconds.
		
		(As ACTOR 7 blows into the chip bag, BACKSTAGE CREW plays
		a composition with a repeated rising tone.)
		
		After she is done, Actor 7 gets up and stomps off to the
		left twice and then walks for 3 steps, turning around and
		moonwalking off the stage while yelling "Be aware of the!"
		
	PART 7...
	
		ACTOR 7 and 2 walk on stage, with nobody else.
		This part is completely silent in terms of background noise, with
		no musical accompaniment.
		
		ACTOR 7 groans out of pure frustration, angrily sifting through her hair.
		Her hands are shaking, and ACTOR 2 is deliberately facing away from ACTOR 7,
		tapping his foot and looking at his wrist as if he were checking the time.
		He doesn't have a watch on.
		
		ACTOR 7 groans again. She's absolutely livid.
		
								ACTOR 7
					(making swift hand gestures as she speaks)
			How the hell could you do that to our own fucking kid?
			You sick pig! You fucking pig! I'm sick of you!
			
								ACTOR 2
					(throws hands up, rolling his eyes)
			Oh, here we fucking go again! New-fucking-headline!
			Woman gets mad at man trying to just set his fucking
			kid straight!
			
								ACTOR 7
					(screaming)
			You sound just like your fucking dad!
			
								ACTOR 2
			And how is that a fucking problem?! At least my
			dad wasn't a fucking shitsack who didn't show up
			to his fucking kid's wedding!
			
			ACTOR 2 takes ACTOR 7's phone and smashes it against the ground.
			
								ACTOR 7
				(scrambling on the ground to try and recover phone)
			What the fuck?!
			
			It seems ACTOR 2 AND 7 harbor immense anger for each other at this point.
			
								ACTOR 2
			Now your fucking kid, who should have been a fucking stillbirth
			stored in a fucking insulated cooler all these 13 fucking years,
			won't be able to tell ANYONE how I'm being a problem!
			
			(continued. Nobody is making sense anymore.)
			
			How is discipline a bad thing? A fucking smack every now and then,
			maybe even the belt! Teaches the kid not to misbehave!
			
							 ACTOR 7
					(livid, pulling her hair out at this point)
			It's hard to fucking deal with you. I'm done with this.
			
		Both ACTOR 2 and 7 groan simultaneously, walking off stage in opposite
		directions.
		
		BACKSTAGE DRUMMER waits for 1 second, and hits a rimshot.
		
	PART 8...
	
		ACTOR 2 and 3 are sitting down on stage, making extremely violent
		hand gestures at one another. Eventually ACTOR 2 stands up and grabs a
		pogo stick, and throws it in a random direction.
		
		ACTOR 2 walks off stage, and trips 20 steps in.
